Not Yet Commons SSL
===================

This is a clone of not-yet-commons-ssl that could be originally found at
http://juliusdavies.ca/svn/not-yet-commons-ssl/trunk
Now that repository is not available and its site is not functioning.

The original contents of the repository (corresponding to version
0.3.17) is available as a tag called '0.3.17-original'.

This is a legacy library
========================

Do not use it if you can avoid it. The author does not support it,
project site is dead.

It is just to allow legacy code run.

Changes
=======

Currently, these are the changes to the original (apart from
the migration to git):

1. SO timeout is set to avoid to freeze forever during a handshake
2. Java 9+ support is added
